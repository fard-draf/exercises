# Sandbox

This repository is a personal **playground** for experimenting, learning, and testing various concepts. It is **not organized or structured**, and it’s not intended to be a standalone project.

The purpose of this sandbox is to:

- Try out new ideas quickly  
- Practice different programming concepts  
- Test tools, libraries, and configurations  
- Learn by doing, without pressure  
- **Keep a trace of what I’ve tried and learned**

⚠️ **Note:**  
Code in this repository may be incomplete, messy, or broken. It’s here to support exploration and learning — not to be reused or maintained.

Feel free to explore if you’re curious, but keep in mind this repo is mainly for personal use.

Made with curiosity and experimentation in mind.
